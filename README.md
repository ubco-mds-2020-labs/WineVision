## Description

The Vinho Verde wine Dashboard has three tabs; Interactive Graphics, Explore the Dataset and Machine Learning.

The Interactive Graphics page contains a number of graphis to explore the effects of physicochemical properties on wine quality. On the left hand side users are able to select the wine type (eg. red wine, white wine) as well as the physicochemical features of interest, with subset ranges if they so desire. Some possible visualizations are as follows:

- Variable density distributions for each quality category comparing red vs white.
- Stacked distribution of variable counts in each quality factor.
- Scatterplot with interactive slide bar for the quality label and dropdown for property to plot against. This plot will also allow users to select a specific area and generate a bar plot demonstrating the quality distribution in this range.
- Scatterplot to plot any two physicochemical properties against each other.

The Explore the Dataset tab will focus on descriptive data analysis, allowing users to generate summary statistics for groups of their choice. Users will also be able to sample raw data for a closer look at the numbers.

Lastly, the Machine learning tab will focus on modelling and machine learning techniques. This section will be primitive in the early stage of the project, and will likely just include simple linear regression for now. We plan to expand this section when we do the project in R.
