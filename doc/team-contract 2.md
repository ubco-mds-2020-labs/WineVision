# Team Contract

**Decision Making**
- We should require a consensus vote (100% passing vote) to pass decisions; however, 75% majority will be accepted if no reasonable compromise can be reached.
- If someone is fixated on a particular idea, we should not pressure the individual to act on it in the current moment. Instead, a comment should be noted in the document where the disagreement exists and the team should have at least a day to reflect on the fixation and alternative.

**Meeting Expectations**
- We should expect to meet at least once per week (in person or on Zoom) to discuss the current state of the project and to evenly distribute weekly objectives for the project.
- We should meet every Monday @ 7:30pm to plan out our weekly objectives.
- Additional meetings can be expected as project deadlines approach.
- Each member should prepare and be ready to discuss the completed tasks prior to each meeting.

**Work Expectations**
- We should expect each member to work on the project during their own time and to continuously update the Slack group so that extra meetings remain redundant, providing more time to focus on the project itself (minimizes necessary meetings).

**Distribution of Work**
- Work should be distributed based on consensus agreements on what each individual may want to, offers to, or is requested to pursue. These will be established during our weekly meetings and noted in the tasks document in the repo.
- If specific tasks take longer than expected or need extra research and/or discussions, issues need to be brought up timely and work can be distributed again based on agreement.
- Team members are expected to contribute to collaborative tasks reasonably evenly and of their own volition. If it is found that a team member is not pulling their weight, the issue will be gently discussed over Slack or in a meeting.

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others in order to get the team an A?**
- “A” quality work is expected of all group members. Members who wish to engage deeper with the material and create content exceeding these expectations are encouraged to do so, but will not be granted further claim to the project than their 25%
- Excessive contribution should not negate the assigned work of another individual. If a member is producing low quality work, the first step should be to encourage them to improve it themselves, instead of another member jumping in to redo it.

**Where will you record who is responsible for which tasks?**
- We will have a weekly task file in the repo to keep tabs on what we’re accomplishing and what each person is responsible for on a weekly basis. Any extra work should be added to this file to show all that you are doing.
- Personal notes may be needed to record individual tasks and expected finishing time and output?
- All members will keep track of their individual contributions over the week in a shared google doc. These notes will be transferred to a markdown file at the end of the week. 
 
**What will happen if someone does not follow through on a commitment (e.g., missing a deadline, not showing up to meetings)?**
- The team should follow up with them closely and frequently until their tasks are finished. 
- For anyone who can’t make their commitment, they should explain why to the group and try their best to finish it as soon as possible. If not possible they should reach out for help and assistance, ideally before the set deadline.
- If extenuating circumstances such as illness or injury befalls a team member during the course of the project, other team members will act compassionately and help the individual fulfill their commitments until they are capable of returning to a regular workflow. At this point, if possible, they will take on some extra work to make up for their lost productivity.

**What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?**
- Alternative solutions, comments, and feedback should be provided and substantiated to address why work is of lower quality and how to feasibly improve it. If the improvement does not come with large time costs we should always be open to incorporating it.
- If the standard however is uncertain among any individuals, a group vote or consensus should be made to decide if further changes/improvements are necessary or not.
- These can be good opportunities to reach out to the TA or instructor for clarification and/or suggestions when necessary.

**Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?**
- Agendas can be discussed and posted in Slack prior to the meetings.
- Minutes can be included in the group notes and in the TODO document.

**How will the work be reviewed?**
- Each member will be responsible for reviewing, testing and verifying other group members’ work.
- Any problems noticed need to be brought up timely and discussed as a group.
- Individuals assigned easier and less time consuming tasks may be expected to devote more time to quality control.
