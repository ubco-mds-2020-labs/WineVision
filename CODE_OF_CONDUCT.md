### The Viz Project Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background
or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our team members or that excludes, 
intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics 
that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status,
genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education,
socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

#### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions
should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional
working environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all communications:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

#### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by group members include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Group members who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any communications, either online or in-person. If a member engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the group may warn the offender and or engage the Course Instructor or TA to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
