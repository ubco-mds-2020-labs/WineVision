### Introduction

This code of conduct governs the working process of the DATA551 dashboard project.

All members of our team are expected to show respect and courtesy to others and conform to this code of conduct.

### Scope

The contents of this code of conduct apply to all interactions including, but not limited to, meetings, discussions, and online communications such as Slack channel, Github repo and/or in person.

All team members are responsible for enforcing the code of conduct. All reports will be shared with the TA or instructor.

### The Viz Project Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background
or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our team members or that excludes, 
intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics 
that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status,
genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education,
socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions
should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. Each member of the team is expected to be considerate of other members across the project. Members are expected to be supportive of each other.

All steps need to be completed in a collaborative manner. Feedback of the output and reviews are needed on each stage.
In order to foster a positive and professional working environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all communications:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by group members include:

- negatively responding to other members
- ignorance to the messages and discussions
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

### Process for Reporting Complaints

- Bring up directly during meetings or discussions
- Post issues in the Slack channel 
- Group discussion when necessary

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Group members who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any communications, either online or in-person. If a member engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the group may warn the offender and or engage the Course Instructor or TA to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
